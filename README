YachtTransfer
=============
  http://github.com/jordanr/yacht_transfer/tree/master

  As a Rails plugin, this library allows you to both download and upload 
  yacht listings from/to yacht MLS sites (like yachtworld, yachtcouncil, 
  bucnet, marinesource, ...).  With your own app, you can then centrally
  manage the listings.  Instead of separately managing listings, you can
  control them from a single source.  You will not have to upload a listing
  multiple times or have disparities between listings.

  It does not directly access an MLS server.
