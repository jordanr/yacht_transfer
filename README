YachtTransfer
=============
  http://github.com/jordanr/yacht_transfer/tree/master

  As a Rails plugin, this library will eventually allow you to upload 
  yacht listings to the yacht MLS sites yachtworld and yachtcouncil
  With your own app, you can then centrally manage listings.  You can
  control them from a single source.  You will not have to upload a 
  listing multiple times or have disparities between listings.

  It does not directly access an MLS server.
