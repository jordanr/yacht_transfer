<title> About yacht id#'s</title>
<body> 
This page will tell what an id# is, what you can do with an id#, and where you might find one. You probably do not<br>
need to read this web page.  Only if you want to transfer yachts that are not in your web listings do you need a <br>
yacht id#.  You only need to find a yacht's id# if you want to transfer a yacht web listing of another brokerage.
<br>
<h2>What is an id#?</h2>
Yacht listing websites assign a unique id# to each yacht you enter.  The id# is the online social security number <br>
of that yacht.  You can use the id# to find out all the information about that yacht.<br>
<br>
<h2>What can you do with one?</h2>
This site can transfer any yacht given that yacht's id#.  This site allows you to do two types of <br> 
transfers: brokerage to brokerage and site to site.<br>
<br>
One, brokerage to brokerage, you can transfer another brokerage's listing to your listings on the same website.<br>
Both you and they have an open listing on that yacht. Find the yacht's id# and enter the id# here.  See below for<br>
how to find a yacht id#.<br>
<br>
And, two, you can transfer yachts between your accounts on two yacht listing websites.  Again, just find the id#<br>
and enter it here (or forget the id# and just choose the yacht name from your listings on the previous page).<br>
<br>
<h2>How do you find one?</h2>
You can find a yacht id most easily by searching for that yacht on the yacht listing website you wish to transfer <br>
from.  Once you locate the listing on the website, the page will display the yacht's id#.  Locate the id# and <br>
copy it into the textbox on this site.<br>
<br>
For example, on YW listing id#'s can be found on a yacht's display or full specs page under the "Engine/Fuel <br>
Type" marker.<br>
